Please note that you can choose between Apache 1.3 and 2.0, and that you can
install them in parallel. If you have both versions installed, 2.0 will
start by default. To switch from one to the other, run the following
commands: "/usr/sbin/advxrun1.3" or "/usr/sbin/advxrun2.0".
<p>
The Apache documentation packages (if installed) are available here:
<a href="./manual-2.0/index.html">[2.0]</a>
<a href="./manual-1.3/index.html">[1.3]</a>, 
as well as the Documentation for some standard modules

Mandrake Linux now comes with SSL encryption (mod_ssl), we suggest you install it
for more security. It comes with its own test key so you can start using it
right now, or, thanks to Mandrake's new partnership with
Thawte, you can now buy an SSL certificate through MandrakeSoft! See <a
href=http://www.advx.org/thawte.php>this page</a> for more
information. Thawte SSL certificates will enable the SSL on your web
server, giving you the ability to communicate securely with your web
customers. SSL security makes eavesdropping on your web traffic almost
impossible.

<h1>
<a NAME="about"></a>About Apache</h1>
This product includes software developed by the Apache Software Foundation
(http://www.apache.org/).
<p>
The 
<a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Project</a>
 is a collaborative software development effort aimed
at creating a robust, commercial-grade, featureful, and freely-available
source code implementation of an HTTP (Web) server. The project is jointly
managed by a group of volunteers located around the world, using the Internet
and the Web to communicate, plan, and develop the server and its related
documentation. These volunteers are known as the Apache Group. In addition,
hundreds of users have contributed ideas, code, and documentation to the
project.
<p>Apache is <b>the most popular web server in the world</b>, with around
60% market share, more than twice than Microsoft IIS!
<p>According to <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey">Netcraft</a>, "The
widespread deployment of Apache amongst hosting companies and ISPs ensures
that Apache is in a better position to echo the growth of the web than any
other server, and this has been a longterm theme of the Web Server survey."
The last Netcraft survey reported more than 22 million Apache servers worldwide.
